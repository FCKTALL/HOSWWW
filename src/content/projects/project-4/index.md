## Project Description

This project focuses on creating a data self-destruction system for Hermetic OS, allowing users to instantly and irretrievably erase data from their phone. This system is designed for individuals who need to ensure their data can be securely and permanently destroyed at a moment's notice.

## Application Name

The application will be called **Data Oblivion**.

## Project Goals

- **Instant Data Erasure:** Provide a mechanism for users to immediately wipe all data from their phone.
- **Irretrievable Deletion:** Ensure that once data is erased, it cannot be recovered by any means.
- **Customizable Configuration:** Allow users to configure the self-destruction settings according to their specific needs.

## Implementation Overview

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Establish the development environment for Hermetic OS.
   - Create a new project or module within Hermetic OS for the self-destruction system.

2. **Data Erasure Mechanism:**
   - Develop a secure data wiping process that overwrites data multiple times to prevent recovery.
   
3. **User Configuration:**
   - Implement a user interface that allows users to configure self-destruction settings, such as triggers and scope of data to be erased.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Incorporate additional security measures to ensure that the self-destruction process cannot be tampered with or triggered unintentionally.

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion, **Data Oblivion** will enable users to securely and irretrievably erase all data from their phone instantly. This feature will provide an additional layer of security for individuals who require the highest level of data protection.
